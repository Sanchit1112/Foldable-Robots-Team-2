## Research Question

* How can a snake-inspired biodegradable robot be created using foldable robotics principles?


## Biomechanics

|Length          |m          | .3-.9            |
|Average Speed              |ft/s|  0.33-0.197           |
| Forward sliding friction coefficient             | unitless         | .3±.06       |
| Backward Sliding friction coefficient            |unitless          |  .42±.05      |
|  Cost of Working (partial energy cost of movement)            |    J/(kg*m)   |  .5-1           |
|Ground Friction Reaction Force|N | 2.4±.05|

## Kinematics

* 2-D model using two 2-bar linkages (AB and ED) with a constant distance at endpoint. Creating 1 independent state qAi and 3 dependant states qBd, qDd, qEd.
* The force at the end effector was estimated using recorded mass and acceleration to estimate ground reaction forces.
* This was then used with the external Jacobian to calculate the required input torque of 0.31 N*m
