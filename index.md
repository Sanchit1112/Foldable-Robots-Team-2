## Research Question

* How can a snake-inspired biodegradable robot be created using foldable robotics principles?


## Biomechanics

## Kinematics

* 2-D model using two 2-bar linkages (AB and ED) with a constant distance at endpoint. Creating 1 independent state qAi and 3 dependant states qBd, qDd, qEd.
* Constraints were added to make the two vertical links parallel and pFE and pDC have the same y component. These simulate the constraints a 3-D representation of a saurus linkage would hold.
* Using this model the internal and external Jacobians were calculated to map output velocities and forces to input angular velocities and torques to qAi.
* The force at the end effector was estimated using recorded mass and acceleration to estimate ground reaction forces.
* This was then used with the external Jacobian to calculate the required input torque of 0.31 N*m
* These kinematics are to be revised with the new design of the robot, but similar methods will be used to create the updated model.
